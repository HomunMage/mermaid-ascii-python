Project dir: ${PROJECT_DIR}

Read these files:
1. ${PROJECT_DIR}/llm.plan.status
2. ${PROJECT_DIR}/llm.working.status

Based on the current phase and progress, generate EXACTLY ${NUM_WORKERS} independent, non-overlapping tasks
that workers can do IN PARALLEL without conflicting with each other.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Tasks must work on DIFFERENT files/modules (no two workers editing the same file)
- Each task should be small and self-contained
- Tasks should advance the current phase
- If there's only 1 task left, write just 1 task and put SINGLE on the second line

Output format (ONLY output this, nothing else):
TASK1: <one-line description of task 1>
TASK2: <one-line description of task 2>

If ALL phases are complete, output only:
ALL_DONE
